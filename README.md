# NeuralNet

## About
This is a small c++ program that will initialize a neural network of nodes with random names and random weights

### To Compile and run use "sh run.sh"
This will run my script. Any subsequent runs can be ran with "./run"

### Or manually compile with "g++ hash.cpp"

###Example Output
